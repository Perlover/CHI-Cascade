I would want to do (may be you want to do yourself and push request to github?:)

    - To add doc for throwing a object of CHI::Cascade::Value from compute code
    - Make tests for dependence type as sub {...} (not checked)
    - To need corrections of my English in docs (my English is not well as i
      want)
